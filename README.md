# 🔥Find your solution
- Press "T" in windows/mac/linux to open the file finder.
- Enter your problem name. We support only following naming formats to find files! Note: We are slowly migrating to normal word spacing format for new files, see [Contributing.md](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
  - ### Old questions finding
    - PascalCase (ThisIsTheExampleOfPascalCaseWritingWriting)
    - Snake case (this_is_the_example_of_snake_case_writing)
    - Caterpillar case (this-is-the-example-of-catarpillar-case-writing)
    - Normal (A question name with proper words and spacings)
    - Most of Leetcode Questions also have question numbers. Eg. 1007-minimum-domino-rotations-f...
  - ### New questions finding
    - Normal (A question name with proper words and spacings)
    - Proper structure with folders/directories according to coding platforms.
- If exists, select your solution file according to your programming language.
- If your problem's solution doesn't exist
  - Either create an new [Issue](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/issues) and request public to solve it for you.(Coming soon...)
  - Or [Contribute](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/pulls) it by yourself🔥
