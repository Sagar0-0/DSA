## Two numbers with odd occurrences


Given an unsorted array, Arr[] of size N and that contains even number of occurrences for all numbers except two numbers. Find the two numbers in decreasing order which has odd occurrences.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
N = 8

Arr = {4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 3, 1}

Output: {5, 1} 

Explaination: 5 and 1 have odd occurrences.
```
**Example 2:**

```
Input:
N = 8

Arr = {1 7 5 7 5 4 7 4}

Output: {7, 1}

Explaination: 7 and 1 have odd occurrences.
```

**Your Task:**
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **twoOddNum()** which takes the array Arr[] and its size N as input parameters and returns the two numbers in decreasing order which have odd occurrences.


**Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
2 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ Arri ≤ 1012
