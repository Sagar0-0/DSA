## Help Ishaan

Ishaan has been given a task by his teacher. He needs to find the **Nth** term of a series. His teacher gives him some examples to help him out (Refer examples below). He is a bit weak in pattern searching so to help him his teacher told him that the **Nth term is related to prime numbers**. The Nth term is the **difference of N and the closest prime number to N.** Help him find the Nth term for a given N.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: N = 10

Output: 1

```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: N = 7

Output: 0

**Your Task:**

You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **NthTerm()** which takes **N** as input paramater and returns **Nth** term.
 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N* âˆš N)
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Constraints:**
1 <= N <= 100000
