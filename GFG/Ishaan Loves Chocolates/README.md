Ishaan can eat the first or the last square of the chocolate at once. Ishaan has a sister who loves chocolates too and she demands the last chocolate square. Now, Ishaan being greedy eats the more tasty square first.&nbsp;<br>
Determine the tastiness level of the square which his sister gets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function <strong>chocolates()</strong> that takes an array <strong>(arr)</strong>, sizeOfArray <strong>(n)</strong>&nbsp;and return the tastiness level of the square which his sister gets. The driver code takes care of the printing.</span></p>
