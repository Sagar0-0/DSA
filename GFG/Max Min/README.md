## Max Min

Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the **sum of minimum and maximum** element in the array.

```
Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {-2, 1, -4, 5, 3}

Output: 1

Explanation: min = -4, max =  5. Sum = -4 + 5 = 1
 ```
 
 ```

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
A[]  = {1, 3, 4, 1}

Output: 5

Explanation: min = 1, max = 4. Sum = 1 + 4 = 5
 
```

**Your Task:**

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **findSum()** which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the summation of minimum and maximum element of the array.

 

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

 

**Constraints:**
1 <= N <= 105
-109 <= Ai <= 109
