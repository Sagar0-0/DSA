## Sequence Fun

You have a sequence 2,5,16,65,........Given an integer n as input. You have to find the value at the nth position in the sequence.
 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 65
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 9864101
 
```
***

**Your Task:**

You don't need to read or print anything, Your task is to complete the function **NthTerm()** which takes n as input parameter and returns value at nth position of the given sequence modulo 109 + 7.
 

**Expected Time Complexity:**  O(n)
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(1)
 

**Constraints:**
1 <= n <= 104
