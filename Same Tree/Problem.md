Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

Example 3:

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```

Constraints:

```
The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
```
