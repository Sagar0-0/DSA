<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/">1268. Search Suggestions System</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>You are given an array of strings <code>products</code> and a string <code>searchWord</code>.</p>

<p>Design a system that suggests at most three product names from <code>products</code> after each character of <code>searchWord</code> is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with <code>searchWord</code>. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.</p>

<p>Return <em>a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of </em><code>searchWord</code><em> is typed</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
<strong>Output:</strong> [
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"]
]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
<strong>Output:</strong> [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
<strong>Output:</strong> [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= products.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= products[i].length &lt;= 3000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= sum(products[i].length) &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li>All the strings of <code>products</code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
	<li><code>products[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= searchWord.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>searchWord</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>
