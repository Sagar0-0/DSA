## ✅ How to Contribute

### Issues

> **Please Use Issue templates according to your requirements(if available).**
- Take a look at the existing [Issues](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/issues) or [create a new issue](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/issues/new)!
- [Fork the Repo](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/fork). Then, create a branch for any issue that you are working on. Finally, commit your work.
- Create a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/compare)** (_PR_), which will be promptly reviewed and given suggestions for improvements by the community.

### Pull Requests

> **Please Use PR templates according to your requirements(if available).**
### 💻Code PRs
- Currently, we only cover problems of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/), [GeeksForGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions) and [InterviewBit](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions). Problems of other good platforms will be accepted(ONLY AFTER [DISCUSSIONS](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/discussions)).
- Previously any code was just contributed to the main directory but due to overflow of files, we decided to structure the repositroy by creating specific directories corresponding to coding platoforms i.e. LeetCode, GFG, InterviewBit.
- ⚠️Please contribute your code in the right directory!! Example - LeetCode questions should be in the LeetCode directory and same for others.
- **All leetcode questions should be in the LeetCode directory(if contributed manually)/(Non-LeetHub users).**
- [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub) users, only you can upload your code in the main directory from now.(only using extension)
- **MUST CHECK** if that question already exists or not!! Follow following steps:  
Example- A solution named "Nine divisors.java" is to be added, then first check if any directory(or new PR) with the name "Nine divisors" exists or not and if yes, then move to "Nine divisors" directory and then add your code there(if java file exists then append in that file) or if that folder doesn't exists then create a folder/directory with the name "Nine divisors" and then add your code. [How to create a folder/directory?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34259067/16775065)
- File naming convention: 
  - Every word in the file should be separated by a space. eg. "Rat in the maze" , "19. Remove Nth Node From End of List".
  - ❌No other naming format will be accepted from now.(to maintian the structure)
  - Do not use "/" in the name of any file!(this will leads to creating a directory) 
- Adding Readme.md with any question will be a plus 1
#### Migration PRs
> Help us structure this repository.
- Select a code file from the main/home directory **that was not contributed by LeetHub extension**.
- Add it to the directory of their corresponding coding platform(with a folder name of that problem). Eg. "Nine divisors.java" file should be in the directory "GFG/Nine divisors".
- Delete that file from the home directory.
