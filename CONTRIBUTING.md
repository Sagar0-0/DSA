## ‚úÖ How to Contribute

### Pull Requests

> **Must Use PR templates according to your requirement.**
### üíªCode PRs
- Currently, we only cover problems of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/), [GeeksForGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions) and [InterviewBit](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions). Problems of other good platforms can be accepted(ONLY AFTER [DISCUSSIONS](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/discussions)).
- We maintain the structure of repositroy by creating specific directories corresponding to coding platoforms i.e. [Leetcode](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/tree/main/Leetcode), [GFG](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/tree/main/GFG), [Interviewbit](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/tree/main/Interviewbit).
- ‚ö†Ô∏èPlease contribute your code in the right directory!! Example - LeetCode questions should be in the [LeetCode directory](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA/tree/main/Leetcode) and same for others.
- [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub) users, only you can upload your code in the [main directory](https://github.com/Sagar0-0/DsA) from now.(when using extension)
- **MUST CHECK** if that question already exists or not!! Follow following steps:  
Example- A solution named "Nine divisors.java" is to be added, then first check if any directory(or new PR) with the name "Nine divisors" exists or not and if yes, then move to "Nine divisors" directory and then add your code there(if java file exists then append in that file) or if that folder doesn't exists then create a folder/directory with the name "Nine divisors" and then add your code. [How to create a folder/directory?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34259067/16775065)
- File naming convention: 
  - Every word in the file should be separated by a space. eg. "Rat in the maze" , "19. Remove Nth Node From End of List", etc.
  - ‚ùåNo other naming format will be accepted from now.(to maintian the structure)
  - Do not use "/" in the name of any file!(this will leads to creating a directory) 
- We strictly avoid removing the code of other contributors.
- Check [Beginner's Guide](https://youtu.be/7r05126pOk8) for any issues faced.

#### Migration PRs<!--Not applicable for hacktoberfest-->
> Help us structure this repository.
- Select a code file from the main/home directory **that was not contributed by LeetHub extension**.
- Add it to the directory of their corresponding coding platform(with a folder name of that problem). Eg. "Nine divisors.java" file should be in the directory "GFG/Nine divisors".
- Delete that file from the home directory.
