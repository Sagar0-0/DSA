Given a string  **s** , and a pattern ** p** . You need to find if p exists in s or not and return the starting index of p in s. If p does not exist in s then -1 will be returned.
Here p and s both are case-sensitive.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s = "Hello"
p = "llo"
Output: 
2
Explanation: llo starts from the second
index in Hello.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s = "World"
p = "Doodle"
Output:
-1

```

**Your Task: **
Your task is to complete the function **findPattern() ** which takes two string **s **and **p **as parameter and **returns** an integer.
