Given n balls . All of them are initially  uncolored . You have to color the balls with two colors RED and BLUE such that there can be atmost 2 positions where a RED ball is touching BLUE ball or vice versa. You have to color all the balls.Find the number of ways in which balls can be colored.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Possible ways to color are {{R},{B}}. 
So the answer is 2 .
```

**Example 2:**

```

**Your Task:  **
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function **noOfWays() **which takes n as input parameter and returns  the number of ways in which balls can be colored.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**
1<= n <=10^5^
