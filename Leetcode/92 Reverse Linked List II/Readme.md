92. Reverse Linked List II - Medium

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is n.
1 <= n <= 500
-500 <= Node.val <= 500
1 <= left <= right <= n

Follow up: Could you do it in one pass?
